Werry Client for Minecraft 2026
Werry is the most powerful free Minecraft hack client, specially optimized for mini-games, PvP servers, and anarchy gameplay. Its killer feature is the built-in JavaScript script loader — allowing you to load custom .js scripts for server-specific bypasses, unique modules, and advanced automation. This makes LiquidBounce unbeatable on Hypixel (SkyWars, BedWars, Duels, UHC, Skyblock), Mineplex, CubeCraft, 2b2t, and hundreds of custom servers. Clean UI, strong anti-cheat bypasses, Baritone integration, and constant updates make it the #1 free scriptable client.
